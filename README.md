# Next.JS With Firebase Boiler Plate

![image of app](/public/readme-img.png)

This repo is a sample [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) integration. I used `yarn create next-app` to bootstrap the project and I did not remove any of the starter files. Feel free to follow along with the YouTube tutorial [here](TODO) and check out the live website hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) [here](TODO).


This repo contains the followng actions implemented:

- Authentication
  - popup auth flow
  - email + password
  - Google OAuth
  - Twitter OAuth
  - GitHub OAuth
- Cloud Firestore
  - read (examples for all availible data types)
  - write
- Realtime Database
  - read
  - write
- Storage
  - Uploade a file (video, image, etc)
- React Bootstrap
  - React Bootstrap installed with minimal styling

This is not meant to be a tutorial on how to use next.js or Firebase, but simply how to connect the two and perform common actions. As always, refer to the docs whenever you might have questions: 

- [next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/build)

This is compatable with next.js v10+ and Firebase JavaScript v8+, which are currently the newest versions. May work with older versions.
